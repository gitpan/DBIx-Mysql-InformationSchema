DBIx-Mysql-InformationSchema version 0.04
=========================================


DBIx::Mysql::InformationSchema - Perl module to access the mysql INFORMATION_SCHEMA view, which contains database metadata.



Mysql 5 introduced a system view called INFORMATION_SCHEMA that contains
metadata describing the structure of all the databases, tables and
columns.

This module provides methods to get at SOME of that data.  While you
certainly can query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA view manually, if your
program uses this data frequently, you may find this module convenient.
In order for this to run, you must already have the DBI perl module
installed.

This module creates and uses its own database handle, stored in
$object->{DBH}.  See the dbconnect method.  To connect, you must supply
a username and password that can read INFORMATION_SCHEMA, which is just
about any valid mysql id.
